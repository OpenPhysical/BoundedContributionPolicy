# Bounded Contribution Policy

**Version 2.0.1** | [Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md)

## Our Standards

This project welcomes technical contributions from people of all backgrounds. We focus on building and maintaining specific technical products.
To help everyone contribute effectively, all discussions and contributions should align with these principles:

### Project Relevance

All contributions must directly support the project's technical goals.
Off-topic discussions, regardless of intent, are out of scope.

### Individual Evaluation

Each contribution is evaluated based on its technical merit and relevance to the project.
Personal identity, background, seniority, or organizational affiliation do not factor into acceptance decisions.

### Focused Communication

Discussions should be clear, concise, and directly related to the problem at hand.
Extended commentary or general debate is discouraged unless it advances the project's technical objectives.

### Constructive Interaction

Feedback must be specific, actionable, and directed toward improving the work.
General critique without technical context or suggested improvements does not advance the project.

Appropriate humor that reinforces project focus (such as gentle redirects to scope) is welcome
when it maintains professional tone and supports productive collaboration.

### Maintainer Discretion

Project maintainers are not obligated to respond to all input.
Engagement is prioritized based on project needs, technical relevance, and available resources.

### Neutral Environment

This project maintains a neutral technical focus.
Social, political, or ideological discussions are outside the project's scope.
All participation must reflect this technical orientation.

## Enforcement

These principles are applied consistently to all participants.
Violations will result in rejection of contributions, removal of access,
or other actions necessary to maintain project focus.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues,
and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct,
and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project documentation
- Community channels officially associated with the project

## Purpose

The Bounded Contribution Policy provides a framework for maintaining focused, productive technical collaboration
by establishing clear boundaries around project scope and contribution evaluation criteria.
