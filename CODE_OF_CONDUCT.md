# Bounded Contribution Policy

## Our Standards

This project is dedicated to building and maintaining a specific technical product. To support that goal, all contributions and discussions must align with the following principles:

### Project Relevance
All contributions must directly support the project's technical goals. Off-topic discussions, regardless of intent, are out of scope.

### Individual Evaluation
Contributions are evaluated individually, based on their technical value and relevance to the project. Personal identity, background, seniority, or organizational affiliation do not factor into acceptance decisions.

### Focused Communication
Discussions should be clear, concise, and directly related to the problem at hand. Extended commentary or general debate is discouraged unless it advances the project's technical objectives.

### Constructive Interaction
Feedback should be specific, actionable, and directed toward improving the work. General critique without context or suggested improvements is not helpful to the project.

### Maintainer Discretion
Project maintainers are not obligated to respond to all input. Engagement is prioritized based on project needs, technical relevance, and available resources.

### Neutral Environment
This project maintains a neutral technical focus. Social, political, or ideological discussions are outside the project's scope. Participation must reflect this technical orientation.

## Enforcement

These principles will be applied consistently. Violations may result in rejection of contributions, removal of access, or other actions deemed necessary by project maintainers to maintain project focus.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to:
- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project documentation
- Community channels officially associated with the project

## Purpose

The Bounded Contribution Policy provides a framework for maintaining focused, productive technical collaboration by establishing clear boundaries around project scope and contribution evaluation criteria.
