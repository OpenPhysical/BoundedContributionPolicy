```

## Response Templates

### Redirecting Off-Topic Discussions

**Gentle Redirect:**

```
This discussion is moving outside our project's technical scope.
Let's refocus on [specific technical aspect]. For broader topics, consider [appropriate venue].
```

**Policy Reference:**

```
This project follows the Bounded Contribution Policy, which keeps discussions focused on technical objectives.
Please see [policy link] for guidelines on relevant contributions.
```

**Constructive Redirect:**

```
Thanks for your interest. To help with this project, we'd benefit from [specific technical contribution].
See our contributing guidelines for examples of helpful contributions.
```

### Requesting More Technical Detail

**Insufficient Detail:**

```
This request needs more technical specifics to evaluate. Please provide:
- Concrete use cases
- Technical requirements
- Implementation considerations
- Compatibility requirements
```

**Vague Feature Request:**

```
To consider this feature, we need:
- Specific functionality description
- Expected behaviour examples
- Technical constraints or requirements
- How this aligns with project objectives
```

### Acknowledging Good Contributions

**Technical Contribution:**

```
This addresses a clear technical need with a well-thought implementation. The [specific technical aspect] is particularly helpful for [technical benefit].
```

**Constructive Feedback:**

```
Thanks for the specific, actionable feedback on [technical area]. The suggested improvements to [technical aspect] would benefit [specific use cases].
```

## Decision-Making Examples

### Feature Request Evaluation

**Request:** "Add support for XML processing"

**Evaluation Process:**

1. **Project Relevance:** Does XML processing support the project's core objectives?
2. **Technical Merit:** Is the implementation technically sound?
3. **Resource Impact:** What are the maintenance and complexity implications?
4. **User Benefit:** Does this solve real technical problems for users?

**Decision Factors:**

- Alignment with project scope
- Technical quality of implementation
- Maintenance overhead
- Community benefit

### Bug Report Triage

**Report:** "Application crashes when processing large files"

**Evaluation Process:**

1. **Reproducibility:** Can the issue be consistently reproduced?
2. **Technical Detail:** Are sufficient technical details provided?
3. **Scope Relevance:** Is this within the project's functional area?
4. **Impact Assessment:** How does this affect project objectives?

**Triage Decision:**

- High priority: Affects core functionality with clear reproduction
- Low priority: Edge case with workaround available
- Declined: Outside project scope or insufficient detail

### Code Review Focus

**Pull Request:** Performance optimization for data processing

**Review Criteria:**

1. **Technical Correctness:** Does the code work as intended?
2. **Performance Impact:** Are the performance claims validated?
3. **Code Quality:** Does it meet project standards?
4. **Documentation:** Are changes appropriately documented?
5. **Testing:** Is adequate test coverage provided?

**Review Focus:**

- Algorithm efficiency
- Memory usage improvements
- Benchmark validation
- Code maintainability

## Project-Specific Adaptations

### High-Performance Computing Project

Focus on computational efficiency, scalability, memory usage, and parallel processing considerations.

### Security Tool Development

Emphasize security implications, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, and compliance requirements.

### Educational Software

Prioritize usability for learning, pedagogical effectiveness, accessibility, and educational outcome measurement.

### Standards Development

Focus on specification clarity, implementation feasibility, backward compatibility, and industry adoption considerations.

## Common Patterns

### Successful Interactions

- Clear problem description with technical details
- Specific improvement suggestions
- Constructive code review feedback
- Well-documented bug reports
- Focused feature discussions

### Problematic Interactions

- Vague requests without technical detail
- Off-topic political or social discussions
- Personal attacks or unconstructive criticism
- Scope expansion requests without justification
- General complaints without actionable suggestions

## Measuring Success

### Positive Indicators

- Increased focus on technical discussions
- Faster decision-making on contributions
- Reduced conflict and confusion
- More actionable feedback and suggestions
- Improved project momentum

### Areas for Adjustment

- High rejection rate may indicate unclear scope communication
- Contributor confusion suggests need for better examples
- Maintainer burden indicates enforcement process issues

## Handling Off-Topic Discussions

Here are examples of professional, firm redirects when discussions move beyond technical scope:

**When someone raises philosophical concerns about your code:**

- "I understand you have broader concerns, but this project focuses specifically on [technical function].
  Let's keep our discussion on the implementation details."
- "That's an interesting perspective. For this project, we need to focus on the technical requirements.
  Could you frame this in terms of specific code improvements?"

**When societal implications are raised:**

- "We appreciate your engagement. This project maintains a technical focus.
  If you have suggestions about the code functionality, we'd be happy to discuss those."
- "Thank you for your input. Our scope is limited to the technical implementation. Let's focus on how we can improve the code itself."

**When discussions become ideological:**

- "This conversation has moved beyond our project's technical boundaries. Please redirect to discussions about code, performance, or functionality."
- "We need to maintain our technical focus. This isn't the appropriate venue for that discussion. Do you have any technical feedback on the implementation?"

**Firmer responses when needed:**

- "This is outside our project scope. We will not be addressing non-technical concerns here."
- "We've explained our technical focus. Further off-topic discussions will be closed without response."
- "This project is for technical collaboration only. Please respect these boundaries or find a more appropriate forum."

Remember: Be consistent, be clear, and be firm. You're not being unkind by maintaining boundariesâ€”you're ensuring everyone can contribute effectively
to the technical goals.

These examples demonstrate how the policy provides clear, consistent guidance for maintaining technical focus while encouraging productive collaboration.
