# Adoption Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the Bounded Contribution Policy in your project.

## Quick Implementation

### Step 1: Add the Policy

Copy the [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file to your project repository.

### Step 2: Reference the Policy

Add a link to your policy in one or more of these locations:

- Project README
- CONTRIBUTING.md file
- Repository description
- Issue/PR templates

### Step 3: Communication

Announce the policy adoption with neutral language focusing on technical benefits:

- Improved focus on technical objectives
- Clearer contribution guidelines
- Reduced ambiguity in project scope

## Detailed Implementation

### Repository Integration

**README.md Addition:**

```markdown
## Contributing
This project uses the [Bounded Contribution Policy](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain technical focus and clear contribution guidelines.
```

**CONTRIBUTING.md Integration:**
Add a section referencing the policy and its key principles without extensive detail.

### Communication Templates

**Announcement Template:**

```
We've adopted the Bounded Contribution Policy to maintain our technical focus and provide clear guidelines for contributions.
This policy helps ensure discussions remain relevant to our project objectives while treating all contributions fairly
based on technical merit.

The policy is available at: [link to policy]
```

**Issue Response Template:**

```
This topic falls outside our project's technical scope as defined in our contribution policy.
Please keep discussions focused on [specific technical area]. For questions about the policy, see: [link]
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

**GitHub:**

- Add policy link to repository description
- Include in issue/PR templates
- Consider adding a repository badge

**GitLab:**

- Reference in project description
- Add to merge request templates

**Discord/Slack:**

- Pin channel rules referencing the policy
- Use bot commands for automated responses

## Customization Options

The policy can be adapted for different project types:

**Open Source Libraries:**

- Emphasize technical documentation and testing
- Focus on compatibility and performance discussions

**Research Projects:**

- Highlight reproducibility and methodology
- Maintain focus on research objectives

**Internal Teams:**

- Adapt language for organizational context
- Include references to internal processes

See [CUSTOMISATION.md](CUSTOMISATION.md) for detailed adaptation guidance.

## Enforcement Guidelines

### Consistent Application

- Apply principles uniformly across all contributors
- Document decisions for consistency
- Focus on behaviour and content, not individuals

### Escalation Process

1. Redirect off-topic discussions
2. Reference specific policy sections
3. Use prepared response templates
4. Escalate to maintainer discretion if needed

### Common Scenarios

- Off-topic discussions: Redirect to appropriate venue
- Unconstructive feedback: Request specific, actionable suggestions
- Scope creep: Reference project objectives and boundaries

## Success Metrics

Projects typically see:

- Reduced time spent on non-technical discussions
- Clearer contribution decisions
- Improved focus in issue discussions
- Simplified moderation requirements

Regular review of these metrics helps validate policy effectiveness.
