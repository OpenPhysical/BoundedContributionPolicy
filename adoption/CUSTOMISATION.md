# Customization Guide

The Bounded Contribution Policy can be adapted for different project types, organizational contexts, and technical domains
while maintaining its core principles.

## Core Principles to Maintain

When customizing the policy, preserve these essential elements:

- **Project relevance** - Contributions must support technical objectives
- **Individual evaluation** - Assess work without regard to contributor identity
- **Neutral environment** - Maintain technical focus
- **Clear boundaries** - Explicit scope limitations
- **Maintainer discretion** - Project leadership autonomy

## Project Type Adaptations

### Open Source Libraries

**Focus Areas:**

- API design and compatibility
- Performance and optimization
- Documentation and examples
- Testing and quality assurance

**Customization Example:**

```markdown
### Technical Standards
Contributions must address library functionality, performance, compatibility, or documentation. Discussions should focus on
implementation details, API design, testing approaches, or user experience improvements.
```

### Research Projects

**Focus Areas:**

- Methodology and reproducibility
- Data analysis and interpretation
- Experimental design
- Publication and dissemination

**Customization Example:**

```markdown
### Research Relevance
All contributions must directly support the research objectives, methodology validation, or result reproducibility.
Discussions should center on technical implementation, experimental design, or data analysis approaches.
```

### Internal Corporate Projects

**Focus Areas:**

- Business requirements alignment
- System integration
- Compliance and security
- Delivery timelines

**Customization Example:**

```markdown
### Business Alignment
Contributions must support defined business requirements and project deliverables. Discussions should focus on technical
implementation, system design, security considerations, or delivery objectives.
```

### Standards Development

**Focus Areas:**

- Specification clarity
- Implementation feasibility
- Compatibility requirements
- Technical validation

**Customization Example:**

```markdown
### Standards Focus
Contributions must address specification development, implementation guidance, compatibility testing, or technical validation.
Discussions should center on standard requirements, technical feasibility, or implementation considerations.
```

## Language Variations

### Formal/Academic Tone

Replace casual language with more formal alternatives:

- "Project objectives" → "Research aims and objectives"
- "Technical value" → "Scholarly merit and relevance"
- "Maintainer discretion" → "Principal investigator authority"

### Corporate Environment

Adapt for organizational context:

- Reference company policies where appropriate
- Include compliance considerations
- Align with existing governance structures

### International Projects

Consider cultural and linguistic factors:

- Use simple, clear language
- Avoid idioms or colloquialisms
- Provide translations if needed

## Scope Modifications

### Expanded Technical Scope

Some projects may need broader technical discussions:

```markdown
### Extended Technical Relevance
Contributions may address direct technical implementation, related tools and infrastructure, developer experience improvements,
or community technical resources that support the project objectives.
```

### Narrowed Focus

Highly specialized projects may need tighter boundaries:

```markdown
### Specific Domain Focus
All contributions must directly address [specific technical domain]. Adjacent topics, even if technically related, are outside
the project scope unless they directly impact [primary objective].
```

## Enforcement Adaptations

### Community Size Adjustments

**Small Projects (< 10 regular contributors):**

- Simplified language
- Direct maintainer involvement
- Informal application

**Large Projects (> 100 contributors):**

- Detailed guidelines
- Moderation team involvement
- Formal escalation processes

### Platform Integration

**GitHub Integration:**

- Repository badges
- Issue templates
- Automated responses

**Internal Platforms:**

- Wiki integration
- Chat system rules
- Workflow automation

## Common Customization Mistakes

### Avoid These Changes

- Adding identity-based evaluation criteria
- Creating complex governance structures
- Expanding scope to include non-technical topics
- Removing maintainer decision authority
- Making enforcement subjective or unclear

### Maintain These Elements

- Clear, objective criteria
- Neutral language
- Technical focus
- Simple implementation
- Consistent application

## Testing Customizations

Before implementing customized versions:

1. **Review with team** - Ensure understanding and buy-in
2. **Test with examples** - Apply to real scenarios
3. **Validate clarity** - Check for ambiguous language
4. **Confirm enforcement** - Ensure practical implementation
5. **Document decisions** - Record customization rationale

## Template Structure

When creating customized versions, maintain this structure:

1. **Purpose statement** - Why the policy exists
2. **Core principles** - What guides evaluation
3. **Scope definition** - What's included/excluded
4. **Enforcement approach** - How principles are applied
5. **Contact information** - Who to reach for questions

This structure ensures clarity and consistency across different customizations.
