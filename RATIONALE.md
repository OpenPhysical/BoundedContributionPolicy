# Rationale for the Bounded Contribution Policy

## Purpose and Objectives

The Bounded Contribution Policy addresses common challenges in technical project management by establishing clear criteria for contribution evaluation and scope management. This document explains the reasoning behind the policy's design and its practical benefits.

## Core Problems Addressed

### Scope Creep and Mission Drift

Technical projects often face pressure to expand beyond their original objectives. Without clear boundaries, discussions can shift from implementation details to broader topics that don't advance the project's goals.

**Policy Solution:** Explicit project relevance requirements ensure all contributions directly support technical objectives.

### Inconsistent Evaluation Criteria

When contribution evaluation lacks clear standards, decisions can appear arbitrary or biased, leading to frustration and inefficiency.

**Policy Solution:** Individual evaluation based on technical merit provides consistent, objective criteria for all contributions.

### Communication Inefficiency

Lengthy discussions about tangential topics consume time and attention that could be focused on technical development.

**Policy Solution:** Focused communication requirements direct discussions toward actionable, project-relevant outcomes.

### Maintainer Overload

Project maintainers often feel obligated to respond to all input, even when it doesn't advance project objectives.

**Policy Solution:** Maintainer discretion allows leaders to prioritize engagement based on project needs and available resources.

## Design Principles

### Neutrality Over Ideology

The policy avoids taking positions on social or political issues, instead focusing on technical collaboration frameworks that work regardless of broader viewpoints.

**Benefit:** Reduces conflicts by keeping discussions centered on shared technical objectives rather than divisive topics.

### Simplicity Over Complexity

Rather than creating elaborate governance structures, the policy provides straightforward principles that can be applied consistently.

**Benefit:** Lower implementation overhead and clearer expectations for both maintainers and contributors.

### Clarity Over Ambiguity

Explicit boundaries and evaluation criteria reduce uncertainty about what constitutes appropriate contributions and feedback.

**Benefit:** Fewer misunderstandings and more efficient decision-making processes.

### Individual Focus Over Group Identity

Evaluating work based on technical merit rather than contributor characteristics supports fair assessment and reduces bias.

**Benefit:** Creates an environment where good ideas can emerge from anyone while maintaining quality standards.

## Practical Benefits

### For Project Maintainers

**Reduced Decision Fatigue:** Clear criteria simplify contribution evaluation and reduce the mental overhead of complex judgments.

**Protected Project Vision:** Explicit scope boundaries help maintain project focus and prevent mission drift over time.

**Improved Efficiency:** Less time spent on off-topic discussions means more time available for technical development.

**Clearer Communication:** Standardized expectations reduce the need for repeated explanations of project boundaries.

### For Contributors

**Clear Expectations:** Explicit guidelines help contributors understand what types of contributions are welcome and how they'll be evaluated.

**Fair Evaluation:** Merit-based assessment ensures that good technical contributions are recognized regardless of contributor background.

**Focused Feedback:** Technical discussions produce more actionable results than broader conversations.

**Reduced Frustration:** Clear boundaries prevent contributors from investing time in off-topic work that won't be accepted.

### For Projects Overall

**Maintained Focus:** Projects stay aligned with their original technical objectives rather than expanding into unrelated areas.

**Improved Quality:** Consistent evaluation criteria help maintain technical standards across all contributions.

**Efficient Collaboration:** Clear communication guidelines reduce misunderstandings and conflicts.

**Sustainable Growth:** Manageable scope and clear expectations support long-term project sustainability.

## Comparison with Alternative Approaches

### Traditional Codes of Conduct

While codes of conduct focus on behavior and community standards, the Bounded Contribution Policy addresses contribution management specifically. Projects may use both approaches for comprehensive governance.

**Advantage:** Addresses technical project management needs not covered by behavioral guidelines.

### Open-Ended Contribution Policies

Some projects accept any type of contribution or discussion. While inclusive, this approach can lead to scope creep and inefficiency.

**Advantage:** Maintains project focus while still welcoming diverse technical perspectives.

### Strict Technical-Only Policies

Some projects restrict discussions to implementation details only, potentially limiting valuable input on requirements or direction.

**Advantage:** Balances technical focus with appropriate flexibility for project-relevant discussions.

## Implementation Considerations

### Cultural Adaptation

The policy's neutral framework can be adapted for different cultural contexts while maintaining core principles of individual evaluation and technical focus.

### Scale Flexibility

The approach works for both small projects with single maintainers and large projects with complex governance structures.

### Platform Independence

The principles apply regardless of technical platform, making the policy useful across different development environments.

## Long-Term Sustainability

### Reduced Burnout

Clear boundaries and evaluation criteria help prevent maintainer burnout by reducing the emotional labor of managing complex social dynamics.

### Maintained Quality

Consistent technical focus helps projects maintain quality standards over time as they grow and evolve.

### Predictable Evolution

Explicit scope management allows projects to evolve intentionally rather than drifting away from their original objectives.

## Conclusion

The Bounded Contribution Policy provides a practical framework for managing technical projects by establishing clear boundaries and evaluation criteria. Its neutral, principle-based approach supports effective collaboration while maintaining project focus and sustainability.

The policy's value lies not in restricting contributions, but in providing clarity that enables more effective technical collaboration. By focusing on what the project is trying to achieve and how contributions are evaluated, teams can work more efficiently toward shared technical objectives.
