## Overview

The Bounded Contribution Policy provides a straightforward approach to managing project contributions by establishing clear boundaries around scope and evaluation. It emphasizes technical merit, project relevance, and maintains a neutral environment focused on productive collaboration.

## 🎯 Key Principles

- 🎯 **Project-Focused**: All contributions must directly support technical objectives
- ⚖️ **Individual Evaluation**: Work is assessed based on technical value, not contributor identity
- 🚧 **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit scope limitations reduce ambiguity and conflict
- 🧘 **Neutral Environment**: Technical discussions remain separate from other topics
- 🎛️ **Maintainer Autonomy**: Project leads retain control over direction and priorities

## 💡 Why Use This Policy

Traditional governance models can introduce complexity and scope creep that distracts from technical work. This policy provides:

- ✅ Clear expectations for contributors
- 🤝 Reduced conflicts through explicit boundaries
- ⚡ Simplified moderation decisions
- 🛡️ Protection of technical focus
- 🚀 Straightforward implementation
