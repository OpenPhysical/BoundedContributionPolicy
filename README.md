A straightforward policy for technical projects that need to stay focused on engineering goals.

## Overall Philosophy

People from all backgrounds and cultures bring valuable technical skills to projects. This policy helps everyone work together on technical challenges
by keeping discussions focused on code, standards, and implementation.

Technical projects work best when conversations stay on-topic. This policy creates clear guidelines so contributors know what kinds of discussions help
the project move forward. It's not about limiting people‚Äîit's about channelling everyone's energy toward building great technical solutions.

The OpenPhysical Foundation uses this policy as a standards body to maintain focus on technical specifications and implementation details.

**Current Version: 2.0.2** ([See Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md))

## Overview

This policy helps projects maintain their technical focus while welcoming contributions from everyone. It provides clear guidelines about project scope
and helps ensure discussions remain productive and on-topic.

By establishing these boundaries upfront, contributors can focus their valuable time and expertise on advancing the project's technical goals.

## üéØ Key Principles

- üéØ **Project-Focused**: All contributions must directly support technical goals
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Individual Evaluation**: Work is assessed based on technical value, not contributor identity
- üöß **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit scope limitations reduce ambiguity and conflict
- üßò **Neutral Environment**: Technical discussions remain separate from other topics
- üéõÔ∏è **Maintainer Autonomy**: Project leads retain control over the direction of the project and its priorities

## üí° Why Use This Policy

Traditional governance models can introduce complexity and scope creep that distracts from technical work. This policy provides:

- ‚úÖ Clear expectations for contributors
- ü§ù Reduced conflicts through explicit boundaries
- ‚ö° Simplified moderation decisions
- üõ°Ô∏è Protection of technical focus
- üöÄ Straightforward implementation

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. üìã Copy [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to your project
2. üîó Reference it in your README or contributing guidelines
3. üõ†Ô∏è Use the provided templates for common scenarios
