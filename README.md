# Bounded Contribution Policy

A technical collaboration framework that maintains project focus through clear contribution guidelines and neutral evaluation criteria.

## Overview

The Bounded Contribution Policy provides a straightforward approach to managing project contributions by establishing clear boundaries around scope and evaluation. It emphasizes technical merit, project relevance, and maintains a neutral environment focused on productive collaboration.

## Key Principles

- **Project-Focused**: All contributions must directly support technical objectives
- **Individual Evaluation**: Work is assessed based on technical value, not contributor identity
- **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit scope limitations reduce ambiguity and conflict
- **Neutral Environment**: Technical discussions remain separate from other topics
- **Maintainer Autonomy**: Project leads retain control over direction and priorities

## Why Use This Policy

Traditional governance models can introduce complexity and scope creep that distracts from technical work. This policy provides:

- Clear expectations for contributors
- Reduced conflicts through explicit boundaries  
- Simplified moderation decisions
- Protection of technical focus
- Straightforward implementation
